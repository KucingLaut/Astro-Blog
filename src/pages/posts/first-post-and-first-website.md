Hi, there! (and say hi to my cat!) Welcome to my blog.

# Who am I?

I am another random person on the internet. I've been working as software engineer in Japan for the last year. Hobbies including talking foods, cooking, cars, software and technology. I also love playing racing games, although not too good at it. Favourite car? **Silvia S15**. Someday I want to own one but man imagine the taxes and maintenance... A man can dream, though.

# What is this blog?

This blog is basically just me writing instead of having to log in to Twitter/X/whatever the name it is, or any social media. It's also serves a nice application to some technologies I learned past few months in free time. This blog is also my first website published online. It's built on top of [Astro](https://astro.build/), using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) for CSS components. Astro because people said it's a great framework for static websites like blogs. Tailwind and DaisyUI because that's the most familiar CSS framework and components I know. I designed the template by myself, which shows you how simple it is. Too simple maybe.

Blog is named "Catsual Blogging" for now. Why, you ask? Because I want to casually blogging, and I like cats. I have bad naming sense, I am aware.

# What can we expect from this blog?

I plan to write things that too long and complex to write to Twitter. Maybe something like small or big trips I made that is interesting, foods that I found interesting, things I found interesting, software engineering stuff (including what I work with at office or outside office), rants, anything. I hope to update here at least once a month. I am also going to add few elements here and there, so expect some changes in UI.

# What's happening now?

Nothing special, really. Work has been pretty okay, nothing special to write home about. Been trying to do dinner prep on weekends, hopefully I can do that as well for lunch. It's few days before new year and few days before I have my year end holiday. Going to spend some time outside, meeting with friends, all that good stuff.
